# JPACRUDProject

## Overview
"My Equipment Service Parts Tracker" is my first solo full-stack, CRUD creation based on MVC design architecture. It was created to solve a problem I experience when needing to perform routine service maintenance on equipment that I own, finding the manuals to look up the common replacement parts such as oil filters, fuel filters or remembering what oil type an engine was last serviced with. The purpose of this full-stack application is for the user to be able to maintain a listing of all their equipment in a one-stop reference when needing to stock up their inventory.

## Lessons Learned

Constructing a solo CRUD project from start to finish has made the process of creating a full-stack application much more clear. The interlinkings across the MVC architecture are no longer a mystery and the importance of simplification through consistent naming conventions. Overcoming the difficulty of ensuring persistence in changes submitted to the database also proved to be an invaluable lesson for difficulties across the various input options a user may have such as a text field or check box. Dividing the project by the acronym CRUD was helpful in approaching the various pieces of the code, taking one letter at a time before moving onto the next. It also was the pattern I used for laying out my code, separatated by comments. From the top down, one section of the class would contain all of the "Create" methods, next "Retrieve" and so on.
