# JPACRUDProject

## Overview
"My Equipment Service Parts Tracker" is my first solo full-stack, CRUD creation based on MVC design architecture. It was created to solve a problem I experience when needing to perform routine service maintenance on equipment that I own, finding the manuals to look up the common replacement parts such as oil filters, fuel filters or remembering what oil type an engine was last serviced with. The purpose of this full-stack application is for the user to be able to maintain a listing of all their equipment in a one-stop reference when needing to stock up their inventory.  

## Status
* 15 August, 2022
	The project is currently designed to meet the requirements of the assignment; build a full-stack CRUD application that utilizes a single table. Future iterations of this project will include multiple tables to appropriately divide the current table into logical portions. Bootstrap will be heavily utilized for the appearance of the web site. 
	
A few stretch goals include... 
	
	1. Having each piece of equipment listed feature a link that will search for the part being referenced online for availability and price reference. 
	2. Toggling sections of information so the user does not see all of the information for each equipment item.
	3. Deploy the application as a mobile app.

## Lessons Learned

Constructing a solo CRUD project from start to finish has made the process of creating a full-stack application much more clear. The interlinkings across the MVC architecture are no longer a mystery and the importance of simplification through consistent naming conventions. Overcoming the difficulty of ensuring persistence in changes submitted to the database also proved to be an invaluable lesson for difficulties across the various input options a user may have such as a text field or check box. Dividing the project by the acronym CRUD was helpful in approaching the various pieces of the code, taking one letter at a time before moving onto the next. It also was the pattern I used for laying out my code, separatated by comments. From the top down, one section of the class would contain all of the "Create" methods, next "Retrieve" and so on.
